			<h1>Experience</h1>
			<h2>Deep Fried Advertising + Web Design</h2>
			<h3>January 2014&ndash;Present</h3>
			<p>An award-winning branding and interactive agency delivering custom responsive websites that are not only true to brand but incredibly easy to maintain.</p>
			<ul class="positions">
				<li class="circle-text circle-text-development position"><span>Senior Developer</span></li>
				<li class="circle-text circle-text-design position"><span>Brand Manager</span></li>
				<li class="circle-text position"><span>Project Manager</span></li>
				<li class="circle-text position"><span>Sales Consultant</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Hired as the Senior Developer, I trained the existing staff of three developers to learn SCSS, basic command line skills, and responsive breakpoints (design specific, not device specific) in the first few months. Over the next year, I expanded their skills so that they're all building custom, responsive WordPress websites with custom post types, custom fields, and version control.</p>
			<p>One of my first tasks, outside of training the staff, was to rebuild the Deep Fried website. The entire framework was rebuilt to be future-proof and easy for any non-technical staff member to update. I contributed to the design, development, and copywriting, which ultimately won the agency its first Addy Award.</p>
			<p>My contributions and skillsets have directly contributed to securing larger, more interactive website contracts. I provide insights for development costs and deliver creative solutions to keep those costs down.</p>
			<p>Notable client work at Deep Fried:</p>
			<ul class="clients">
				<li>Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New Orleans</li>
				<li>Eagle Industries*</li>
				<li>Healthy Course Meals*</li>
				<li>Johnson Rice &amp; Company*</li>
				<li>Kern Studios</li>
				<li>Loan Partners</li>
				<li>Meraux Foundation*</li>
				<li>Michalopoulos</li>
				<li>Tujague&rsquo;s Restaurant*</li>
				<li>Urban Conservancy</li>
				<li>Dr. Lisa Wyatt, DDS</li>
				<li>zlien*</li>
			</ul>
			<p><small>* Denotes projects on which I was not project lead, but contributed to significantly.</small></p>
			<h2>Propel Group</h2>
			<h3>August 2010&ndash;January 2014</h3>
			<p>An award-winning creative agency specializing in digital media, interactive, web design, advertising, branding, and environmental solutions.</p>
			<ul class="positions">
				<li class="circle-text circle-text-design position"><span>Senior Interactive Art&nbsp;Director</span></li>
				<li class="circle-text circle-text-development position"><span>Lead Developer</span></li>
				<li class="circle-text position"><span>Project Manager</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Hired as a web designer, I quickly became the lead developer within months. After my first year, I had become CTO and managed multiple servers, company and client email, and the company intranet. I helped with branding efforts, contributing concepts and feedback to other designers, but my specialty always remained in interactive media.</p>
			<p>I spearheaded the design and development of a furniture manufacturer website with thousands of inventory and introduced an interactive build-your-own furniture tool that replaced over a dozen PDFs from their previous website.</p>
			<p>I have experience building ecommerce websites on ExpressionEngine and BigCommerce, as well as community-building websites using WordPress+bbPress.</p>
			<p>I implemented SVN for version control and later git. I set up a VPN for employees to access the intranet during Dallas&rsquo;s inclement weather, and later used that to work remotely from New Orleans in 2012.</p>
			<p>I managed accounts and projects. I was frequently brought in for technical meetings with clients, and was primary contact for several clients.</p>
			<p>I managed the company email marketing and built templates to expedite communication with our mailing lists.</p>
			<p>I set up multiple social media, AdWords, and Analytics accounts for our clients. I trained clients to use the CMS their websites were built upon.</p>
			<p>I was consulted for estimates being sent to prospective clients and generated monthly maintenance reports for existing clients.</p>
			<p>I implemented a mobile-first development strategy in 2011 with media queries. I also introduced and had great success using style tiles for a few clients instead of full-page static Photoshop renderings.</p>
			<p>Notable clients I performed work for while at Propel Group:</p>
			<ul class="clients">
				<li>ACH Child and Family Services</li>
				<li>Ambit Energy</li>
				<li>Belltower Chapel &amp; Garden</li>
				<li>Big Ol&rsquo; Boy</li>
				<li>Birdpods</li>
				<li>Carter Bloodcare</li>
				<li>Cheryl Ketner Interiors</li>
				<li>Fat Cow BBQ</li>
				<li>LaRousse Salon &amp; Spa</li>
				<li>Laura Wilson</li>
				<li>Massoud Furniture</li>
				<li>Neiman Marcus</li>
				<li>Novation/NovaPlus</li>

				<li>PriceKubecka, PLLC</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>September 2009&ndash;August 2010</h3>
			<p>A niche-market agency providing brochures, print campaigns, media buys, web design, audio/video production, commercials, marketing, and public relations services for some of the most prestigious law firms in the United States and Canada.</p>
			<ul class="positions">
				<li class="circle-text circle-text-design position"><span>Senior Designer</span></li>
				<li class="circle-text circle-text-development position"><span>Senior Developer</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>My role as web designer was to design website concepts and code them either statically or with WordPress. I initiated and developed a project review document for the entire company to track progress and milestones that was previously done via memory and phone conferences. I developed an HTML and CSS framework for the entire development team before Bootstrap and Boilerplate became mainstream. I learned PHP, MySQL, and ssh on the job under the guidance of the IT Director.</p>
